# Alice Cohen

I am a senior DevOps and Cloud Engineer with extensive experience architecting and implementing scalable, robust, and sophisticated cloud solutions. My professional background focuses heavily on advanced cloud architectures, infrastructure automation, observability, and anomaly detection using hybrid machine learning frameworks.

Currently, I am also engaged in space-related projects as part of my role within the AWS Professional Services team.

## Current Projects

### [Adaptive Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/aliceco01/adaptive-anomaly-detection)

An advanced framework designed for real-time anomaly detection across heterogeneous cloud environments. This system employs self-evolving hybrid machine learning techniques, integrating Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to correlate and interpret diverse telemetry streams (metrics, logs, traces) to ensure operational resilience and proactive incident response.

**Core Technologies:**
- AWS EKS and Kubernetes
- Terraform Infrastructure as Code
- Hybrid Machine Learning Models
- Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS CloudWatch

### EKS Observability Dashboard

Architected and implemented an advanced observability platform for Amazon EKS clusters, providing comprehensive visibility into cluster performance and health metrics. Utilizes Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch for actionable insights and efficient monitoring.

### AKS Private Cluster with Application Gateway Ingress Controller

Developed a secure, private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) solution utilizing Azure Application Gateway and NGINX Ingress Controller. This solution provides secure and scalable ingress traffic management tailored for sensitive production environments.

## Professional Skills

- **Cloud Platforms:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation
- **Containerization:** Kubernetes (EKS, AKS), Docker
- **Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD):** Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions
