I am a senior DevOps Cloud Engineer with extensive experience architecting and implementing scalable, robust, and sophisticated cloud solutions. My professional background focuses heavily on advanced cloud architectures, infrastructure automation, observability, and anomaly detection using hybrid machine learning frameworks.


## Current Projects


### [Multi Cloud Adaptive Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/aliceco01/adaptive-anomaly-detection)

An advanced framework designed for real-time anomaly detection across heterogeneous cloud environments. This system employs self-evolving hybrid machine learning techniques, integrating Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to correlate and interpret diverse telemetry streams (metrics, logs, traces) to ensure operational resilience and proactive incident response.

**Core Technologies:**
- AWS EKS and Kubernetes
- Terraform Infrastructure as Code
- Hybrid Machine Learning Models
- Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS CloudWatch

### [EKS Observability Dashboard](https://github.com/aliceco01/AWS-EKS-Observability)

Architected and implemented an advanced observability platform for Amazon EKS clusters, providing comprehensive visibility into cluster performance and health metrics. Utilizes Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch for actionable insights and efficient monitoring.

### [AKS Private Cluster with Application Gateway Ingress Controller](https://github.com/aliceco01/Azure-DevOps-AKS)

Developed a secure, private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) solution utilizing Azure Application Gateway and NGINX Ingress Controller. This solution provides secure and scalable ingress traffic management tailored for sensitive production environments.

### [DevOps Metrics Dashboard](https://github.com/aliceco01/devops-metrics)

Implemented a robust monitoring and visualization solution for tracking performance and operational metrics across continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. This solution provides critical DevOps metrics such as Change Failure Rate, Deployment Frequency, and Code Change Volume, enabling DevOps teams and leadership to measure impact, optimize delivery processes, and make data-driven decisions for continuous improvement.

### [Cloud Endpoint Protection | Real-Time Threat Detection](https://github.com/aliceco01/Endpoint-Protection)

Designed and implemented a comprehensive endpoint protection solution that provides real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Leveraging advanced monitoring techniques, it ensures secure and resilient cloud infrastructure.
